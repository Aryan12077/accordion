                An accordion is a menu composed of vertically stacked headers that reveal more details when triggered (often by a mouse click). Since this web design pattern highlights only the most critical information of a section but makes the rest easily accessible, it’s a common element in responsive design.
                This design pattern is ideal for breaking down longform or complex content into digestible chunks. It’s also ideal for mobile sites since it reduces how much a user has to scroll.

                When readers only need a few key pieces of information: If readers only need some information on a page, then an accordion can help them more easily and efficiently find the information they’re looking for. FAQ pages often use an accordion because many readers are coming to find an answer to one or two questions only.
                When readers will be viewing your site from smaller screens: If you’re challenged with fitting a lot of content on a small screen like a mobile device, then an accordion can help give readers an overview of what the page is about and reduce how much they need to scroll.

                When readers will need to click on the majority of accordion items: If users need to open the majority of accordion items, then it’s better to reveal all the content instead of hiding some. That way you won’t be forcing users to decide which headings to click on and to click on them one at a time, which can be cumbersome.
                When you don’t have the resources to make it accessible: Accordions must be accessible, which is an additional development effort. If you don’t have the in-house support or budget required to meet accessibility standards, then it’s better to use plain text.

                Accordions can help improve the user experience, especially on mobile devices. Since they provide the most important information first, and leave it up to users to decide what to learn more about, they’re ideal for FAQ pages, menu sections on homepages, and more.
